The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the `initializeApp` function is called multiple times with different configurations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.  The error message may not always be clear, making it difficult to debug.

```javascript
//Incorrect
firebase.initializeApp(config1);
firebase.initializeApp(config2);
```
